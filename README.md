# panel_com_g2

panel_com provides a serial port interface to Michael Reiser's Panel Generation 2 controllers, first adapted from the MATLAB `Panel_com.m` script.

**WARNING:** this is in (and will likely remain in) the early development phase, so besides a couple of choice methods, most of the functionalities may not work as expected. If you see any problems, please make a pull request.

## Installation and Setup
Install the package using the following command:
```
python -m pip install panel_com_g2
```

To update the package, use the following command:
```
python -m pip install panel_com_g2 --upgrade
```
