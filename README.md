# panel_com_g2

panel_com provides a serial port interface to Michael Reiser's Panel Generation 2 controllers, first adapted from the MATLAB `Panel_com.m` script.

**WARNING:** this is in (and will likely remain in) the early development phase, so besides a couple of choice methods, most of the functionalities may not work as expected. If you see any problems, please make a pull request.

**ANOTHER WARNING:** This package was largely based on [Will Dickson's panel_comm](https://github.com/iorodeo/panel_comm) but is by no means affiliated with the Reiser or Dickson lab, in any way, shape, or form.

## Installation and Setup
Install the package using the following command:
```
python -m pip install panel_com_g2
```

To update the package, use the following command:
```
python -m pip install panel_com_g2 --upgrade
```
